The Department wants a practical framework that can be used by the Divisions within the Department when designing new programs, that specifies an approach to the type and form of core data that should be collected during the lifecycle of a program. In preparing this guidance, the Consultant should have regard to the wide range of programs delivered by the Department and the corresponding wide range of funding applicants/recipients. A recent review focussing on an environmental scan of grant programs has been undertaken and may contain grants information relevant to this procurement. The guidance should contain a standard set of variables that are to be collected from the funding applicant/recipient (and/or developed by the Department during delivery of the program), irrespective of the program being delivered. It is recognised that individual programs may also seek further data, as necessary for successful delivery of that particular program.&nbsp; 3. The Department seeks expert advice on the feasibility of retrospectively ‘cleansing’ the Department’s catalogue of program data, through applying the guidance material to already established programs.
